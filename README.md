### Element framework implementation for vessel classification
This repository contains a concise implementation of the ELEMENT framework.
The method was implemented using numpy, opencv and sklearn libraries.

### Acknowledgements
The ELEMENT framework and the vessel classification method is implemented using
the research and work done by Ã‰rick Oliveira Rodrigues, based on the 
"X-Ray cardiac angiographic vessel segmentation based on pixel classification using machine learning and region growing" article
by the same author et al.
The dataset used in the paper was also used for evaluation of this implementation, and is available at https://github.com/Oyatsumi/X-RayAngiogramDataset

Implementation of the anisotropic diffusion algorithm was adapted from the works of Aldo von Wangenheim, available at https://github.com/awangenh/fastaniso
